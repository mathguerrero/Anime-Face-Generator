# Anime Face Generation with StyleGAN

After seeing a demo of StyleGAN at one my AI club's weekly workshops, I wondered if it could be applied to anime faces. Turn out someone else had the idea as well! This is my implementation using my own custom datasets, one dataset for an individual character and another for general anime faces.
